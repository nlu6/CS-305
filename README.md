## What is this?
This is going to explain how Monopoly works. Everyone is familiar with the board game, but everyone knows the rules a little differently. This file will explain it all.

###### Rules
Each player starts with **$1500**.
One player acts as the banker. The bank pays out salaries and bonuses, and collects taxes and fines. The bank can't go broke.
Passing Go awards the player **$200**.
If a player lands on an unowned property, they may purchase it from the bank and they receive the deed.
And so on...
