## What is this?
This is going to explain how Monopoly works. Everyone is familiar with the board game, but everyone knows the rules a little differently. This file will explain it all.

###### Rules
Each player starts with **$1500**.
One player acts as the banker. The bank pays out salaries and bonuses, and collects taxes and fines. The bank can't go broke.
Passing Go awards the player **$200**.
If a player lands on an unowned property, they may purchase it from the bank and they receive the deed.
And so on...

##### Trevor's Contribution
I will type up a more comprehensive and detailed document than the one above that covers all of the game's rules to make it clear how to play a traditional game of Monopoly. 

##### Ari Jaramillo's Contribution
I will be focused on maintaining the website where people can get more information about Monopoly. This is a simple task I will doing by using Github websites.
